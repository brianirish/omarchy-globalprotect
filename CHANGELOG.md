# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-10

Initial release.

- Bar widget + panel: connection switch, gateway, address (copy), time connected, throughput sparkline.
- Google SSO through a themed GTK/WebKitGTK window; Google session persists between connects.
- Reusable portal session cookie stored in the GNOME keyring when the portal provides one.
- NetworkManager owns the tunnel via `networkmanager-openconnect`; secrets passed through a 0600 password file.
- Optional HIP report and gateway selection; reported client OS setting.
- SAML sign-in at the gateway interface by default (`authInterface: auto`), for deployments whose gateway demands its own SSO; portal mode remains available.
- Keyboard navigation, desktop notifications, one-click dependency install.
